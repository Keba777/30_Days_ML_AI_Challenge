# Day 15: Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras

## What I Learned
- Introduction to neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Built a feedforward neural network for image classification.
- Worked with the Fashion MNIST dataset to classify clothing items.
- Used TensorFlow's high-level API Keras to simplify neural network construction and training.

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded the Fashion MNIST dataset and preprocessed it for training.
- Built a neural network model with layers: input, hidden, and output.
- Trained the model with backpropagation and gradient descent.
- Evaluated the model's accuracy and performance on the test data.
