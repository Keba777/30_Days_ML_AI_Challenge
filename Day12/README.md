# Day 12: Recommender Systems

## What I Learned
- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - User-based collaborative filtering: Finding similar users based on their preferences.
  - Item-based collaborative filtering: Recommending items based on similar items.
- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - Using item attributes (e.g., genres, descriptions) to recommend similar items.
- **Hybrid Methods**:
  - Combining collaborative and content-based filtering for more personalized recommendations.
- **MovieLens Dataset**:
  - A benchmark dataset for building and evaluating recommender systems.
  - Preprocessing and analyzing user ratings.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Downloaded and explored the MovieLens dataset.
   - Analyzed user ratings and movie features.
2. **Building Recommender Systems**:
   - Implemented collaborative filtering using cosine similarity.
   - Developed content-based filtering using movie genres.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated recommendation quality using RMSE and top-N precision.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualized movie similarities and user preference trends.
