# Day 02 - Data Preprocessing

## Overview
Today's focus is on understanding the foundational steps of data preprocessing, including:
- Cleaning datasets (handling missing values).
- Normalizing features for uniform scaling.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Splitting datasets into training and testing sets.

To solidify these concepts, I worked on preprocessing the Titanic dataset.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Identified missing values in the dataset and filled them appropriately.
2. **Normalization**
   - Scaled numerical features for uniform distribution.
3. **Encoding Categorical Data**
   - Converted categorical features into numerical formats using one-hot encoding.
4. **Data Splitting**
   - Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets.
