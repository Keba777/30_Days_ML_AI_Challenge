# Day 08: Feature Engineering

## What I Learned
- **Feature Selection**:
  - Identifying the most important features in a dataset to improve model performance and reduce complexity.
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Creating new features by transforming or combining existing ones.
  - Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Understanding the importance of scaling features for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude.
  - Techniques like Min-Max Scaling and Standardization.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Feature Selection**:
   - Used correlation and feature importance to identify key features.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
3. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Scaled features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler from Scikit-learn.
4. **Custom Dataset**:
   - Loaded a custom dataset and performed preprocessing and feature engineering.
   - Analyzed the impact of feature engineering on model performance.
