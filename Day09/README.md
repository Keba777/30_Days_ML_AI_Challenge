# Day 09: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## What I Learned
- **Support Vector Machines**:
  - Understanding the concept of SVM and its working mechanism.
  - Kernel tricks: Linear, Polynomial, and Radial Basis Function (RBF).
  - Hyperparameter tuning for SVM models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Used the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn.
   - Explored and visualized the dataset.
   - Performed train-test split for evaluation.
2. **SVM Implementation**:
   - Trained an SVM classifier with different kernel types.
   - Tuned hyperparameters such as `C` and `gamma`.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Visualized decision boundaries for better understanding.
