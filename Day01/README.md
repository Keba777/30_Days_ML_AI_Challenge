# Day 01 - Machine Learning Basics

## Overview
Today's focus is on understanding the basics of Machine Learning, including:
- Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
- Implementing Linear Regression using NumPy.

In addition to completing the tasks, I reviewed the official documentation for **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to deepen my understanding of these essential libraries.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Linear Regression using NumPy**
   - Implemented linear regression from scratch using the normal equation.
2. **Data Exploration**
   - Analyzed and visualized a dataset.
3. **Gradient Descent**
   - Manually optimized parameters for linear regression.
