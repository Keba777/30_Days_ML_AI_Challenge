# 30 Days ML/AI Challenge üöÄ  

Welcome to my **30 Days ML/AI Challenge** repository! This journey is all about diving deep into **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**. Over the next 30 days, I‚Äôll be learning, implementing, and documenting various ML/AI concepts and projects.

## üóÇ Repository Structure  
The repository is organized into 30 folders, one for each day of the challenge. Each folder contains:  
- **README.md**: Documentation for the day's tasks, learnings, and resources.  
- **Code/Projects**: Implementation files and notebooks for the day's topic or project.

## ‚ú® Goals  
1. Master fundamental and advanced ML/AI concepts.  
2. Gain hands-on experience by working on real-world projects.  
3. Build a solid foundation in **Deep Learning** with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
4. Document everything to ensure a comprehensive learning process.
