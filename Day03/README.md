# Day 03: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## What I Learned
- The importance of visualizing data for identifying patterns and relationships.
- How to create effective visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Analyzing correlations between features using a heatmap.
- Extracting insights from visual representations.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - Loaded the Iris dataset and reviewed its structure.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plot for Sepal Length vs Sepal Width by species.
   - Pair plot to explore relationships between all features.
   - Box plot for Petal Length distribution across species.
3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Heatmap showcasing correlations between numerical features.
