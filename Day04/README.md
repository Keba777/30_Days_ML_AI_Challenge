# Day 04: Supervised Learning

## What I Learned
- **Linear Regression**: Understanding how to predict continuous outcomes using linear relationships between variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: Learning to predict binary or categorical outcomes.
- How to preprocess and clean data for supervised learning.
- The concept of training and testing data splits.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the California Housing dataset and handled missing values.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Linear Regression**:
   - Built a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.
   - Evaluated the model using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
3. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Explored Logistic Regression for predicting binary outcomes (optional).
   - Compared the results to linear regression.
